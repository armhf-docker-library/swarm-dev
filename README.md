[![Build Status](https://armdrone.strahlungsfrei.de/api/badges/armhf-docker-library/swarm-dev/status.svg)](https://armdrone.strahlungsfrei.de/armhf-docker-library/swarm-dev)

This is a port of the development Docker image for [swarm](https://github.com/docker/swarm) for the armhf architecture. You probably want to use [`armhfbuild/swarm`](https://github.com/armhf-docker-library/swarm) for real usage instead.
